1. Is the current method of saving the classifier blocking to the tornado IOLoop? Justify your response.
Yes it is blocking the IOLoop because saving to the database could take some time, and since tornado uses a single-threaded 
event loop, any process that takes some time will block the IOLoop. 


2. Would the models saved on one server be useable by another server if we migrated the saved
documents in MongoDB? Justify your response.
Yes because the models are declared as dictionaries so if they are migrated to another server the corressponding DSID will
be able to access the correct model.
